# Harbor-Branch-Benthic-Microbial-Fuel-Cells---Emerick-Gilliams
This repository holds all of the code and diagrams to recreate various Arduino setups relevant to the Benthic Microbial Fuel Cell Project with Intern Emerick Gilliams and Dr. Jordon Beckler

A voltmeter that measures up to 3.3V using a Arduino Pro Mini, micro SD module, DS3231 Real Time Clock. This device saves the voltage readings to the micro SD card every 10 minutes. When not recording data, the Arduino goes into sleep mode in order to conserve energy for extended battery life. The circuit will use 0.84mA on average.
