Hello!

I see you are looking to modify the following modules in order to replicate the circuit that was built.

The first step before modifying the modules is to understand why. 
These modifications were made to lower the current consumption in order to extend the battery life.
After the modifications, the current during sleep mode of both the triple input, double input and single input circuit is 0.8mA. 
After the modifications, the current during active measurement is 4.8mA for a single input, 5.0mA for a double input, and 5.2mA for a triple input.

Why the following modifications were made:

DS3231 Real Time Clock Module: 
	⦿ Removal of the diode in the top left of the module...
		- This was removed to disconnect the trickle charge current that goes into the battery socket which attempts to charge the battery.
		I recommend the use of a CR2032 3V Lithium Coin Battery. If you use this battery, the trickle charge the module is attempting to provide can explode the battery.
		If you decide to use a rechargeable battery, you can keep this. That being said, I suggest against using the rechargeable battery over the CR2032 3V Lithium Coin Battery. 
	⦿ Removal of the Power LED in the bottom left of the module...
		- This was removed to lower the power consumption of the module in sleep and active mode, as the power LED is on at all times.
		The removal of this saved about 2 mA in sleep and active mode. This is a must remove to maximize power consumption. 

Micro SD Card Module:
	⦿ Removal of the AMS1117 Voltage Regulator...
		- This is a must remove IF you are using a 3.3V, 8MHz, Pro Mini Module (Or any Arduino/Microcomputer setup operating at 3.3V).
		Micro SD cards operate at 3.3V originally. The Micro SD module used in the project has a voltage regulator that takes a 5V input from an Arduino/breadboard/source and regulates it to a 3.3V for the SD card.
		Since we are operating at 3.3V, this regulator will not work correctly. This is a MUST remove if operating under these conditions.

Arduino Pro Mini 
	⦿ Removal of the Power LED...
		- This was removed to lower the power consumption of the module in sleep and active mode, as the power LED is on at all times.
		The removal of this saved about 2 mA in sleep and active mode. This is a must remove to maximize power consumption.

How to make the Modifications: 
#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~

Supplies Needed 
- Heat Gun
- Insulated Tweezers
- Soldering Iron 
- Rosin Core Solder

The removal of the components is relatively easy! All components follow the same steps to be removed from the PCBs (Printed Circuit Board).
1. Plug in Heat Gun
2. Turn on Heat Gun 
3. Use Heat Gun to warm the ENTIRE board. 
	- The board doesn't need to be as hot as the component you are heating, but it is helpful to heat the whole board slightly. 
4. Focus the Heat Gun on the component you are removing with one hand, and pick up the tweezers with the other hand. 
5. Either pick up the component with the tweezers once the solder is warm enough, or you can just knock the component off its pads by tapping it if there is enough room.
6. Turn off Heat Gun

This is all you need to do for all of the modifications excluding the Micro SD Module. 

For the Micro SD Module, after removing the regulator, the voltage input and output pins need to be connected. 
For the AMS1117 module on my Micro SD Module, I have the pinout available in the modification folder. 
Since the relevant pads for the AMS1117 module were next to each other, I connected the pads with a solder blob. It's ugly, but it works. 
Make sure you double check the model of regulator you have before doing this to make sure you know which pads are which!
Or better yet, buy a micro SD module for 3.3V and you've saved yourself a step!

Happy Modifying!
