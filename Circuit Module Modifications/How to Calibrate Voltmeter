Hello!

Calibrating your Voltmeter code to get accurate voltmeter readings is very easy!

All you have to do is take the positive lead of a multimeter and connect it to the VCC pin either through a breadboard or directly. 
You then connect the negative lead to the ground of a breadboard (if connected to the arduino ground) or to the ground on the arduino directly.

The voltage your multimeter is reading is what should be entered into the "Cali" variable in any of the codes. 

Make sure to recalibrate when switching between like LiPos, PC USB slots, and other power sources.
